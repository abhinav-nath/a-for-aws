## Regions and Availability Zones

Regions are all around the world (ex: us-east-1, eu-west-2 ...)

A region is a cluster of data centers

Most AWS services are **region-scoped**

### How to choose an AWS region?

- **Compliance** with data governance and legal requirements: _data never leaves a region without your explicit permission_
- **Proximity** to customers: _reduced latency_
- **Available services** within a region: _new services and new features aren't available in every region_
- **Pricing** varies from region to region
