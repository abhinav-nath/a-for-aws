# Identity and Access Management (IAM)

IAM provides fine-grained access control across all of AWS.
With IAM, you can specify who can access which services and resources, and under which conditions.

- IAM is a **Global service**
- **Root account** created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
- Create Users using the Root account
- **Users** are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- **Groups** only contain users, not other groups
- Users don't have to belong to a group, and one user can belong to multiple groups
